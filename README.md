Making interactive social and connectivist teaching easy, both in-class and online.

### Summary

A course centres on an activity stream, where teachers, tutors, and students can post content, polls, questions, etc. Much of the content that you and your students will post naturally "lives" on the web. This helps your students to bring the wider world of materials into your course, and it helps them relate your teaching to their discussions and to the wealth of other material that is out there. Everything is topic-tagged and filterable, to make relating content and navigating between it easy.

Click on content to bring it up in "the viewer". This is useful for presenting in class and for students working at home.  

A live chat stream (that can also handle other interactions, such as live polls) sits next to both the viewer and the activity stream.  You can open the chat stream next to your content on the main screen, letting the class converse on the lecture screen (useful for getting questions from the class), and students can continue the conversation outside class from the activity stream.

It's designed to work both in-class and on-line. It's fairly simple to set up, and designed with scalability in mind. And there's lots more features either written or planned.
