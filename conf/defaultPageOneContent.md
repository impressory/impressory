## Page One

This page has been tagged `page one`. That just means that if you click `Open to page one`, you'll be shown some content that has this tag.

You can edit this page, or you could delete this page and tag something else as `page one`, so that it will appear instead.  

## Markdown Pages

This page is a wiki page using a format called "Markdown". It's a fairly popular format on the web, because it's readable both as plain text and when it's turned into a web page. Click edit to see what it looks like.

But Markdown Pages aren't all you can add.  You could put in 

* Videos and live broadcasts
* Live polls
* Presentations using Google Slides, reveal.js, and more
* Embed other web pages


## The interaction stream

If you click on the orange chat icon over on the right, that'll open the stream. This isn't just for chat. You can push out polls on it (you'll need to create a poll first), and we're going to add more tools to help you over time.
